# Translated Articles
I am very interested in the history of science in my field: energetics and muscle mechanics. Unfortunately, some historical papers are published in either French or German. In order to understand them, I have translated these papers into English. In this repository, I share these translations so that they will (hopefully) be available to a wider audience! 

## Method
1. I performed OCR using ABBY FineReader.
2. I made some manual changes and edits.
3. I exported this to a text file, which was then translated into English using Deep

## Files
### Files available per article
Each translation has it's own folder. In these folders you will find the following files:
- The original pdf file.
- A pdf file that has been OCR'd (i.e. you can copy and paste the text!).
- A Word file containing the text of the essay
- And, of course, a Word file with the translation of the text.
